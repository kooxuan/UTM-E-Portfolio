PC Assemble
On 1st November 2023, I had attended my first PC Maintenance class which held at Makmal Invoasi (322-02) N28, Level 3A.
In this class, I have learned how to open and install the CPU.
And here are the steps to open the CPU: 
1.	Open the cover of the computer case.
2.	Unplug all cables, except the black one.
3.	Open the power supply unit.
4.	Unplug the 2GB RAM .
5.	Remove the 250GB hard disk.
6.	Open the cooling fan.
7.	Open the processor.
Through this lesson, I get to know more about computer and the class is fun and interesting.
